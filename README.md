# Chatbot featuring Loki characteristic     
------------------------------------    
Loki can be your "friend" who you can talk to whenever you are feeling stressed or just simply bored af         
Eventhough he claims he is smart, he is quite a bit retarded both physically and mentally due to the lacks in skills of the practitioner :))) :`(      

### Feature     
Some well-known libraries in python: nltk, np, torch, random.    
Neural Net with only 5 layers and pretrain = False :)    
Using tokenize, stem, and bags of word techniques to process inputs      
tkinter library is used for UI     


##### intents.json        
All the training data is saved in `intents.json`          
We have tags and each tag contains some patterns and their responses    
Feel free to modify and have some fun with this file    


##### data.pth    
All hyperparameters and trained model are saved in this file.    
I recommend not to mess with this file :v     

 
##### Usage    
You need to download intents.json, nltk_utils.py, model.py, train.py, chat.py and data.pth(if you do not want to train it again)   
In order to train model, you only need to run train.py file and remember to have some fun with intents.json    
Run app.py to chat with Loki.      


   
**Peace out**
